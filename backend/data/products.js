    description:
      "Introducing, the all-new charge pipe lineup, from Kies Motorsports! The charge pipe and boost pipe are the pipes that hold pressurized air from your turbo and take it to your engine. Unfortunately, BMW typically makes OEM charge pipes out of plastic or rubber, which is a terrible idea for holding pressurized air. While this is a very cost-effective thing for a manufacturer to do, they typically fail when the plastic starts to age, especially when you start to turn up the boost in your car!",

    name: "APEX Flow Formed ARC-8 BMW Wheel",
    image: "/images/wheel1.jpg",
    description:
      "An optimized car setup begins with the perfect wheel and tire fitment. Without model-specific attention to each wheels specifications, maximum performance is compromised. Each size was selected to find the right balance between a clean fit and the most grip possible. The ARC-8's wide range of widths, diameters, offsets and face profiles result in unique fitments ranging from 8 to 10.5 wide. Each wheel combines these features to meet the different brake caliper, strut, and fender clearance needs of each BMW model. Most vehicle models have options for wheels that range from direct-fit to aggressive for specialty applications. Daily drivers and professional racers don't have the same needs, so why should they be forced to buy the same exact fitment?",
